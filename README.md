========================

NFCWorkout is a native (Java) android application that uses Java, SQLite and NFC. The idea with the app is that it when you workout, you will be able
to scan your gym machine with your phone using NFC. When the scanning is complete, you will recieve all the necessary information about your
current workout using that machine and it will be saved in your profile. This will save you a lot of time and will let you focus on your workout
instead of having to document every single workout on a existing workout app manually.
